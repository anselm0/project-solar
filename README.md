## Team:  Anselmo Garza Jr, Alfonso Moreno

Summary:  Project Solar will be an exploration of market opportunities for energy saving home improvements using big data and machine learning.  The platform will visualize energy cost savings in defined geo areas using solar kW data.  Homeowners and property owners will be able to use the platform to determine whether investing in an energy saving improvement is cost saving or not based on estimates.  We plan to use different mapping APIs to visualize the data, and big data (solar data) and machine learning techniques to uncover areas with the most potential.
